The tool is used to extract PPCG defined QC metrics from Sanger variant calling pipeline results.

## Inputs

### `-tb`/`--tumour_bas`: Tumour sample BAS file(s), `-nb`/`--normal_bas`: Normal sample BAS file(s)

  A BAS file is one of the output of Sanger mapping pileline (cgpmap), which contains metrics collected during mapping and it has `.bas` suffix.

  The option can take files or directories as input. Multiple entries should be separated by a white space. When input is a directory, only files with '.bam.bas' extension at the directory ***root*** will be taken. Subfolders are ignored.

### `-rt`/`--variant_call_tar`: Vaiant calling result tar file(s)

  The result tar file of Sanger variant calling pipeline (cgpwgs Version 1.1.2), or directories containing those files. Again, only a directory ***root*** is searched. If a `tar.gz` file is found in input and it's not a valid Sanger variant call pipeline output, the tool will exit.

### `-o`/`--output_tar`: Output tar file

  The output file. It has to have a `.tar.gz` extension. If it exists when the tool starts, the tool will exit non-zero.

### `-mt`/`--metadata`: Metadata file(s) (optional)

  Ideally this will be the tsv files generated by `validate_sample_meta.pl` of [cgpNgsQc](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpNgsQc) when validating BAM's metadata. Besides the columns required by the tool ([more details](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpNgsQc/wiki#validate_sample_metapl)), a metafile used here can have `Sequencer` and `Sequencing year` columns.

  The option can also take directories as input, in which case all `.tsv` files at the directories' ***root*** will be taken as metadata. However if same `Sample_ID` or `Sample_UUID` is found more than once in the files, the tool will exit.

### `-cv`/`--count_variants`: Count variants (optional)

  This flag is default to false. If specified, the tool will also count number of variants called by Sanger Variant Calling pipeline.

### `-gs`/`--genome_size`: Genome size (optional)

  It's required for calculating sequencing depth. Default to the sum of length of GRCh37 chromosomes.

## Outputs

Output of the tool is a tar file containing the following files:
